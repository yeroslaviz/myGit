## Step 0: Install git and create a GitHub account 

Of course without installing git on your computer and having a git account you cannot use git. so first do this.

- [installing git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
- [Github account](https://github.com/join)

## Step 1: Create a local git repository 

```shell
$ cd ownCloud/ownCloud_Personal/ownCloud_projects/AG_Cox/github/
$ mkdir myGit
$ cd myGit/
```

To initialize the git repository, one can use the command line as such

```shell
$ git init
```

In my case I will use RStudio, which can create a porject already with versioning control using `git`. It takes an already existing Github repository and uses it, so it doesn't need to be initialized. 

## Step 2: Add a new file to the repo

Here we can add any file we need. Again as I havr already created it via an exiting Github repository, I ahave already a few files in it.

```shell
$ ls
HOWTO_git.Rmd  HOWTO_git.html LICENSE        README.md      myGit.Rproj
```

Using `git status` one can see the status of my git repository and which files in my local folder are known to the repositoy online.

```shell
$ git status
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        HOWTO_git.Rmd
        HOWTO_git.html
        myGit.Rproj

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

A `commit` is a record of what changes you have made since the last time you made a commit. Essentially, you make changes to your repo (for example, adding a file or modifying one) and then tell `git` to put those changes into a `commit`.

How do you tell `git` which files to put into a `commit`? This is where the `staging environment` comes in. As seen above, when you make changes to your repo, `git` notices that a file has changed but won't do anything with it.

To add a file to a `commit`, you first need to add it to the staging environment. To do this, you can use the `git add <filename> command`.

## Step 3: Add a file to the staging environment

This is done using the `git add` command. Again T RStudio takes care of that for you, when one just put the ticks in the Git tab on the left (where is says `Staged` - this is adding to the staging environment).

```shell 
$ git add HOWTO_git.*

$ git status
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
        new file:   HOWTO_git.Rmd
        new file:   HOWTO_git.html

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        myGit.Rproj
```

Now, after we added the two files, they are ready to be committed. 

## Step 4: Create a commit

By committing the files to the repository they will be added also on the Github website

```shell
$ git commit -m "Adding html files"
[main aca3ae5] Adding html files
 2 files changed, 297 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 HOWTO_git.Rmd
 create mode 100644 HOWTO_git.html
```
