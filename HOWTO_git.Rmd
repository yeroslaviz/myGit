## Step 0: Install git and create a GitHub account 

Of course without installing git on your computer and having a git account you cannot use git. so first do this.

- [installing git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
- [Github account](https://github.com/join)

## Step 1: Create a local git repository 

```shell
$ cd ownCloud/ownCloud_Personal/ownCloud_projects/AG_Cox/github/
$ mkdir myGit
$ cd myGit/
```

To initialize the git repository, one can use the command line as such

```shell
$ git init
```

In my case I will use RStudio, which can create a porject already with versioning control using `git`. It takes an already existing Github repository and uses it, so it doesn't need to be initialized. 

## Step 2: Add a new file to the repo

Here we can add any file we need. Again as I havr already created it via an exiting Github repository, I ahave already a few files in it.

```shell
$ ls
HOWTO_git.Rmd  HOWTO_git.html LICENSE        README.md      myGit.Rproj
```

Using `git status` one can see the status of my git repository and which files in my local folder are known to the repositoy online.

```shell
$ git status
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        HOWTO_git.Rmd
        HOWTO_git.html
        myGit.Rproj

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```
