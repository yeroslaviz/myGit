## Creating a HTTPS token

In order to be able to communicate with the git server, it is necessary to create a so-called Token. this token varify the identity of the person trying to connect to the server. 

Using R libraries such as `usethis` and `gitcreds` make it possible to do this from within R. 

```r
usethis::create_github_token()
```

will pop-up a new browser windows, where the user can create a new token.

It is always good to give the token a specific name, which will help identify, what it is for and why it was created. 

After the token was created, **remember to copy it first before continuing**. It is not possible to see the token again,s once the page was reloaded.

```r
gitcreds::gitcreds_set()
```

Without this token, one cannot communicate with the server, i.e. commiting a `pull` or `push` requests.
